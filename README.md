# PIC_using_cuda

The c++ code was inspired from python code(https://medium.com/swlh/create-your-own-plasma-pic-simulation-with-python-39145c66578b)

The Jacobi iterative method has been used to solve Electric potential poisson equation. The function/subroutine for solving electric field has been 
impimented using cuda to take the advantage of the GPUs.


# Quick Start

1. need cuda 
2. need intel compiler (tested on 19.0 or 20.0)
3. run ./run.sh command on terminal 
   or execute one command at a time on terminal found in run.sh
